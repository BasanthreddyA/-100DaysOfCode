// Longest Consecutive Sequence
// https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/
/*
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Apporch is  we are inserting all values into the set
then we are finding (num-1) values in set are not , when it is not found in the set we are going to (num+1)
then we (num+1) we count the value and finally we will return the value */

    for(int num: nums) set.add(num);
    int result = 0;
 
    for(int num: nums){
